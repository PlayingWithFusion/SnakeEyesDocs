# [SnakeEyes Raspberry Pi Hat](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?pdid=133&catid=1014)

## What Is It?

SnakeEyes is a circuit board which conforms to the Raspberry Pi hat physical specifications, and provides the following functionality:

 * 12V Passive POE extraction (for supported Pi models)
 * High-power, software-dimmable LED target illumination
   * Two versions available: [**traditional green**](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?catid=1014&pdid=133) and [**infrared**](https://www.playingwithfusion.com/productview.php?catid=1014&pdid=134).
 * Regulated power supply for LED's and Raspberry Pi main board
 * Connections for cooling fan

## What Is It Not?

SnakeEyes is designed to be one core component in a vision processing solution - it is not a plug-and-play vision processing solution by itself. The goal is to give teams flexibility to build and customize a system as they desire, while robustly taking care of "less-critical" electrical considerations.

SnakeEyes will require some assembly and fabrication, as well as some work to load and run software. 

## How to Use This Guide

This is a guide to help you get set up using the SnakeEyes vision processing hat. 

The platform is designed for experimentation! The goal is help DIY folks with a portion of their development process. 

This guide seeks to further help by providing a few known-good paths to success.
