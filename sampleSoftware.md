Almost any Raspberry Pi based vision processing solution could be made to function with SnakeEyes. There are currently two tested paths to success:

### PhotonVision

[PhotonVision](https://photonvision.org/) is an open-source GUI-based vision system. 

[Click here for documentation on using SnakeEyes with PhotonVision](PhotonVision/readme.md)

### FRCVision

[WPILib provides a raspberry Pi image with many common utilities pre-installed](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/raspberry-pi/index.html).
