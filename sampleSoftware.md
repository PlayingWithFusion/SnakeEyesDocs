Almost any Raspberry Pi based vision processing solution could be made to function with SnakeEyes. There are currently two tested paths to success:

### PhotonVision

[PhotonVision](https://photonvision.org/) is an open-source GUI-based vision system. 

[Click here for documentation on using SnakeEyes with PhotonVision](PhotonVision/readme.md). It is the preferred approach for software to interact with SnakeEyes.

### WPILibPi

[WPILib provides a raspberry Pi image with many common utilities pre-installed](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/vision-processing/raspberry-pi/index.html).

[Click here for documentation on using SnakeEyes with the WPILibPi Image](WPILibPi/readme.md) A simple example is included, but is limited in functionality. PhotonVision is the current "prime-path" recommendation.
