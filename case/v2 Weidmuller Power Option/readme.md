# v2 Case with Weidmuller Power Access

![v2 caseW eidmuller](https://github.com/PlayingWithFusion/SnakeEyesDocs/raw/master/case/v2%20Weidmuller%20Power%20Option/Case%20with%20Weidmuller%20Power.jpg)

This case improves the v1 design with fewer clearance issues, fewer small parts to manage, and increased sd card access. It also includes access port for the external Weidmuller power ports.

You will need all the same metric bolt hardware as the v1 case, and need to print one of each .stl.
