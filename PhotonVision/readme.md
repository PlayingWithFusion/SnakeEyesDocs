# PhotonVision and SnakeEyes

[PhotonVision](https://photonvision.org) is one option for vision processing software which is compatible with SnakeEyes.

# Getting Started

[A pre-configured SnakeEyes image.zip](https://github.com/PlayingWithFusion/SnakeEyesDocs/releases/latest) is provided. 

First, download the image .zip file.

Then, flash your Raspberry Pi with this image, following [the instructions from PhotonVision.](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/docs/getting-started/installation/coprocessor-image.html#raspberry-pi-installation)

All the reset of the [PhotonVision docs](https://docs.photonvision.org/en/latest/index.html) should apply as normal.

Successful flashing should allow you to see and control the LED brightness from the PhotonVision Settings page:
